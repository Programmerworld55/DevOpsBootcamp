# ðŸš€ DevOps Bootcamp â€“ My Daily Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is my personal DevOps learning log.

I'm Asad, a MERN Stack Developer and Computer Science student, currently transitioning into DevOps. I'm learning DevOps step by step and documenting everything here to track my progress and grow publicly.

## ðŸ“˜ What This Repo Contains

Every day, I document what I learn â€” including notes, commands, tools, and key takeaways. This is part of my "learn in public" approach to stay consistent, track progress, and help others who are on a similar path.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Iâ€™m Doing This

- To build real-world DevOps skills  
- To stay accountable through daily practice  
- To prepare for a DevOps internship  
- To support and inspire others starting from scratch

## ðŸ“¢ Weekly Updates

I post a weekly recap every weekend on LinkedIn.
